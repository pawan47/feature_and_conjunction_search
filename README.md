# Computational Cognitive Science Assignment 2

## Libraries needed
* numpy
* opencv
* matplotlib


## Instructions
* python3 is recommended. Hereafter, whenever python is mentioned, python3 is inferred.
### Q1
#### How to run

```
python q1.py
```

This generates the results of various shapes being detected, image after image. Once an image's result is shown, close the image window and results for other images follow.

### Q2
#### How to run

```
python q2.py
```

This asks for input parameters, 
the first line is for choosing between feature search or conjunction search, put 0 for feature search and 1 for conjunction search and 2 to exit.
the second line asks for number of objects, enter a number less than or equal to 100.

For example, when you run: python q2.py
```
enter 0 for Feature Search, 1 for Conjunction Search and 2 to exit
0
enter the number of points. This number should not be more than 100
9
```

#### Output
You get the details of the color and shape for each frame along with frame's bounding box .


### Q3
#### How to run
```
python q3.py
```
It plots the graph of the times taken for feature search and conjunction search vs the number of objects chosen.
